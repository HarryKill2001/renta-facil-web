## Critical Notes

### Mandatory Architectural Compliance
Every task must be implemented following these **REQUIRED** principles:
- **SOLID Principles** - Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion
- **Clean Architecture** - Domain → Application → Infrastructure → Presentation layers
- **Domain-Driven Design** - Proper bounded contexts and domain modeling
- **Repository Pattern** - Generic repositories for data access
- **Code First Entity Framework** - Simple entities with basic relationships

### MVP Simplicity Guidelines
- Keep Entity Framework implementation simple with basic CRUD operations
- Use only one-to-many relationships for MVP
- Implement straightforward business logic without over-engineering
- Use generic repository pattern consistently
- Maintain basic but consistent error handling

### Development Standards
- Follow C# naming conventions (PascalCase for classes/methods, camelCase for variables)
- Use TypeScript strict mode in Angular
- Implement proper Git workflow with feature branches
- Use conventional commit messages
- Maintain comprehensive test coverage
- Never commit secrets or sensitive configuration
